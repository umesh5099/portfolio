            <p class="para1"><b>January</b> is the first month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and the first of seven months to have a length of 31 days. The first day of the month is known as New Year's Day. It is, on average, the coldest month of the
                year within most of the Northern Hemisphere (where it is the second month of winter) and the warmest month of the year within most of the Southern Hemisphere (where it is the second month of summer). in the Southern hemisphere, January
                is the seasonal equivalent of July in the Northern hemisphere and vice versa.<br> My <b>Resolution</b> for this new year month is to spend more time with the people that matter: There is just too little time in this life for us to waste
                it on insincere, duplicitous and toxic people. We should focus on the people who we care about deeply and who care about us, as this is the best way to stay happy.

                    It is the year's shortest month with only <b>28 days</b> in common years and <b>29 days</b> in <b>leap years</b>. A February birth flower is primrose. It is the only month of the year that has less than 30 days and was also the second
                    month in the Julian calendar, the Gregorian calendar's predecessor.
                    <br> My <b>Resolution</b> for this new month is to <b>read books </b> beacause many of us have special memories of the books that have inspired us, and have learned the profound effect that reading the right book can have at the right
                    moment.

                    <br> My <b>Resolution</b> for this new month is to <b>meditate</b>. I will take meditation class and start pacticing meditating at least 30 minutes everyday for the month. Hopefully, I will not fall asleep everytime I meditate. Meditation
                    is often defined as thinking continuously about one object of thought. We often get stuck on this definition, however, and lose the real purpose of meditation. Meditation must reveal the true nature of that object upon which we are
                    meditating. Such revelation comes not as a thought, but as a feeling. Therefore, meditation is a process in which we shift from thinking to feeling. It is a journey from the complexity of mind to the simplicity of heart. It is for
                    this reason that most methods of meditation involve the heart.</p>
