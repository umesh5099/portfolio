            <br><br>
            <p class="para1">Here, in India <b> January</b> is the coldest month and according to the modern calendar, it is the first month of the year. This month comes with a lot of joy and happiness as 1st January is treated as the new year day. This month on new
                year's day, most people take various types of resolutions because they think that whatever resolutions they take they will always stand on them and the things will go according to them the whole year.
                <br> I am also one of them as I also take such resolutions as I will do such and such things so that there will the right path in my future to do things I want them as. There are no such particular resolutions as they change regularly,
                lol. As I said earlier this month is the coldest month north India, so I, my family, and neighbors most the time sits in front of the fire and took the heat to keep us warm. I have a huge courtyard in front of my house, so we all sit there
                and takes heat and also the most important part is we do a lot of gossips and fun together. This goes late at night till 11'clock and even more. We all eat groundnut as it is the most eaten snack in this cold season.
                <br> As it is the coldest month so I even do not take bath for several days, lol, isn't funny, again lol. Yeah, but it is all that it is, truth is truth, no one can deny it.The remaining time of mine is spent in bed under the warm blanket
                using my cellphone chatting with friends, watching youtube videos, and movies. And if everything is fine then sometimes I do the study because it is the most important thing in human life.
                <br>And Here I would like to add some more points regarding my life in the fields. We do have our own land on which we cultivate different types of crops and the crop which is standing on my fields this month is mustard and wheat. So,
                my father is a farmer and he looks and takes care of all these crops. This is the season when we do watering to the crops so that they can grow up to their best. I also used to go to fields and also sometimes for just fun I also do watering
                to the crops using a spade. I used to take food to my father as he spent most of the day in fields and there I eat food with my father. The taste of food is totally different from that I eat at home and in fields. I don't know from where
                it gets the flavour but it tastes totally different and is damn delicious.
                <br>One more point I would like to add is that I do these all only when I am free. As earlier, I go to school and then college and now I am working on growing up my skills. I am allowed to go to fields only either when there is important
                work else when I am free. The above things I mentioned happened very few times.
                <br> So, this was all about the first month of the year things I do.

                    Here comes the second month of the year i.e, <b>February</b>. It is the shortest month of the year having either 28 days(non-leap year) and 29 days(leap-year). This year is also treated as cold but little less than the previous year
                    i.e, January.
                    <br> This month comes with even more joy and happiness. This year is full of energy and everyone can be seen as fully energetic as this is the month in which we celebrate <b>MAHASHIVRATRI</b>(festival of <b>LORD SHIVA</b> ) and also
                    I do. I took fast on this day and pray to Lord Shiva to shower their blessings on everyone and keep them happy always. And also this month I go to fields for the same thing as I mentioned in the month of January but this time very
                    less and there also I do the same things as I mentioned above. This month I had my exams in schools and university so that I have to study and get a good result to make my parents proud. So, I spent most of the time this month studying
                    and doing my best. <br>So, this month I am not having much stuff to do and it was all for this month.

                    loved festival which we Indians celebrate and even foreigners also enjoy this festival. This festival is popularly known as <b>HOLI</b>. This festival is celebrated for two days, on the first day, we had <b> holika dehan</b>. On this
                    day we do puja of holika and later in the night we light the ceremonial fire and we do puja. I and my family lights the fire and we roast raw wheat plants and then we distribute among neighbors as it is treated as prasad.On the second
                    day, we play Holi with colors with our friends, family, relatives.And even I love this festival too much because this is the festival of colors and everyone is fond of colors as this festival has varieties of colors such as red, green,
                    blue, white, yellow, and much more. <br>This is the month in which our mustard crop gets ripped, so we go to fields and harvest it with the help of machines that we have at our home and stores it in our home and this is the time I
                    used to help my father in harvesting and storing the crop. <br> This was all about my curriculum for this month.

                        <br> My <b>Resolution</b> for this new month is to <b>plant trees</b>. Planting trees is one of the main reason that makes this planet habitable. They are the source of oxygen which is essential for survival of all living beings
                        on the Earth. Without this, there is no possibility of life. There are many other benefits of planting trees which include environmental, social and economic benefits. They are the only source of oxygen. They take up the carbon
                        dioxide from atmosphere and release oxygen. Planting more trees can help in reducing the levels of air pollution as they absorb pollutant gases and filter out the particulates. It also maintains the temperature of an area at a
                        lower level than an area that does not have trees. They are also the habitat for birds and many other animals. Trees are also a source of fruits and flowers. Benefits of planting trees also include reducing soil erosion and slow
                        the run off.</p>
