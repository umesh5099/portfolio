            <p class="para1"><b>January</b> is the first month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and the first of seven months to have a length of 31 days. The first day of the month is known as New Year's Day. It is, on average, the coldest month of the
                year within most of the Northern Hemisphere (where it is the second month of winter) and the warmest month of the year within most of the Southern Hemisphere (where it is the second month of summer). in the Southern hemisphere, January
                is the seasonal equivalent of July in the Northern hemisphere and vice versa.<br> My <b>Resolution</b> for this new year month is to spend more time with the people that matter: There is just too little time in this life for us to waste
                it on insincere, duplicitous and toxic people. We should focus on the people who we care about deeply and who care about us, as this is the best way to stay happy.

                <br><br>
                <p class="para1">The name of March comes from <i>Martius</i>, the first month of the earliest Roman calendar. It was named after Mars, the Roman god of war, and an ancestor of the Roman people through his sons Romulus and Remus.
                    <br> My <b>Resolution</b> for this new month is to <b>meditate</b>. I will take meditation class and start pacticing meditating at least 30 minutes everyday for the month. Hopefully, I will not fall asleep everytime I meditate. Meditation
                    is often defined as thinking continuously about one object of thought. We often get stuck on this definition, however, and lose the real purpose of meditation. Meditation must reveal the true nature of that object upon which we are
                    meditating. Such revelation comes not as a thought, but as a feeling. Therefore, meditation is a process in which we shift from thinking to feeling. It is a journey from the complexity of mind to the simplicity of heart. It is for
                    this reason that most methods of meditation involve the heart.</p>

                    <br> My <b>Resolution</b> for this new month is to <b>plant trees</b>. Planting trees is one of the main reason that makes this planet habitable. They are the source of oxygen which is essential for survival of all living beings on
                    the Earth. Without this, there is no possibility of life. There are many other benefits of planting trees which include environmental, social and economic benefits. They are the only source of oxygen. They take up the carbon dioxide
                    from atmosphere and release oxygen. Planting more trees can help in reducing the levels of air pollution as they absorb pollutant gases and filter out the particulates. It also maintains the temperature of an area at a lower level
                    than an area that does not have trees. They are also the habitat for birds and many other animals. Trees are also a source of fruits and flowers. Benefits of planting trees also include reducing soil erosion and slow the run off.</p>

                    any kind of food.Eating wrong amounts of a food group, whether it be too much or too little, is called an "unhealthy diet" or an "imbalanced diet". A healthy diet is one that includes more foods that come from plants and fewer convenience

                    <br>Travel is the activity of going from one place to another place. When a person makes the same trip every day to work or school, this type of travelling is usually called "commuting." Some people travel to other cities as part of

                    <br> My <b>Resolution</b> for this new month is to <b>help needy</b>. Helping others is not only good for them and a good thing to do, it also makes us happier and healthier too. Giving also connects us to others, creating stronger
                    communities and helping to build a happier society for everyone. And it's not all about money - we can also give our time, ideas and energy. So if you want to feel good, do good!
                    <br>Giving isn't just about money, so you don't need to be rich. Giving to others can be as simple as a single kind word, smile or a thoughtful gesture. It can include giving time, care, skills, thought or attention. Sometimes these
