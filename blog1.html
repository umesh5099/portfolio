        <br><br>
        <p class="para1"><b>January</b> is the first month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars 
            and the first of seven months to have a length of 31 days. The first day of the month is 
            known as New Year's Day. It is, on average, the coldest month of the year within most of
            the Northern Hemisphere (where it is the second month of winter) and the warmest month of
            the year within most of the Southern Hemisphere (where it is the second month of summer).
            in the Southern hemisphere, January is the seasonal equivalent of July in the Northern 
            hemisphere and vice versa.<br>
            My <b>Resolution</b> for this new year month is to spend more time with the people that matter: 
            There is just too little time in this life for us to waste it on insincere, duplicitous and toxic
            people. We should focus on the people who we care about deeply and who care about us, as this is
            the best way to stay happy.

            <br>
            My <b>Resolution</b> for this new month is to <b>read books </b> beacause many of us have special memories 
            of the books that have inspired us, and have learned the profound effect that reading the right book can have at the right moment.

        <h1 class="heading1">Third Month- March</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="image1" src="resource/meditate-girl.jpg">
        <br><br>
        <p class="para1">The name of March comes from <i>Martius</i>, the first month of the earliest Roman calendar. It was named after Mars,
         the Roman god of war, and an ancestor of the Roman people through his sons Romulus and Remus.
        <br>
        My <b>Resolution</b> for this new month is to <b>meditate</b>. I will take meditation class and start pacticing meditating at least 30
        minutes everyday for the month. Hopefully, I will not fall asleep everytime I meditate. Meditation is often defined as thinking continuously
        about one object of thought. We often get stuck on this definition, however, and lose the real purpose of meditation. Meditation must reveal 
        the true nature of that object upon which we are meditating. Such revelation comes not as a thought, but as a feeling. Therefore, meditation 
        is a process in which we shift from thinking to feeling. It is a journey from the complexity of mind to the simplicity of heart. It is for this
        reason that most methods of meditation involve the heart.</p>

        <br>
         My <b>Resolution</b> for this new month is to <b>plant trees</b>. Planting trees is one of the main reason that makes this planet habitable. They are the source of oxygen which is essential for survival of all living beings on the Earth. Without this, there is no possibility of life. There are many other benefits of planting trees which include environmental, social and economic benefits.
         They are the only source of oxygen. They take up the carbon dioxide from atmosphere and release oxygen. Planting more trees can help in reducing the levels of air pollution as they absorb pollutant gases and filter out the particulates. It also maintains the temperature of an area at a lower level than an area that does not have trees. They are also the habitat for birds and many other animals. Trees are also a source of fruits and flowers. Benefits of planting trees also include reducing soil erosion and slow the run off.</p>
